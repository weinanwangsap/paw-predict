### Pet Behavior Prediction System

#### Background

You are tasked with designing and implementing a simple pet behavior prediction system. This system allows users to manage virtual pets and provides a basic behavior prediction feature based on pet attributes and user interaction records. The system should be implemented using a mature backend framework such as Spring Boot, Django, or Flask.

#### Task Requirements

1. **Functionality**:
   - **Pet Management**: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   - **Behavior Prediction**: Provide a simple behavior prediction feature based on the pet's basic attributes and user interaction records.

2. **User Interaction Behaviors**:
   - **Feeding**: Record the time and frequency of feeding the pet.
   - **Playing**: Record the time and type of play (e.g., fetch, chase).
   - **Walking**: Record the time and distance of walking the pet.
   - These interactions will affect the pet's state and behavior predictions.

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Use a mature backend framework (e.g., Spring Boot, Django, Flask).
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for data storage.
   - Consider using a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to optimize behavior prediction performance.
   - Provide RESTful API endpoints.

4. **Tools and Techniques**:
   - You are allowed to use search engines, open-source libraries, and AI generation tools.
   - You need to detail the tools and techniques used in the README.

5. **Submission Requirements**:
   - Submit a Git repository URL with code that can be run locally(consider with docker image).
   - Provide a detailed README file explaining how to run the code, the open-source libraries used, prediction algorithm used.
   - Describe how you use AI generation tools in the README.
   - Describe the data model design and user interaction scenarios in detail in the README.

#### Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality Completeness**: Whether all required features are implemented.
- **Code Quality**: Readability, structure, and comments in the code.
- **Architecture Design**: Reasonableness of database design, caching usage, and API design.
- **Documentation Completeness**: The detail and clarity of the README.
